# TACo - Threshold Access Control
We built a demonstration of [Threshold Access Control](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/threshold-access-control) (decentralised, conditional encryption) using the [Anvil](https://anvil.works) web application framework.

**NOTE:** This is a demonstration only. It is not a full implementation. It is not properly secure and should not be used for real-world applications.
